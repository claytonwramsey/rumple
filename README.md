# `rumple`: A Rust Motion Planning Library

This is a side-project implementation of a generic robot motion planning framework, mostly inspired by [OMPL](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org).
The goal of this project is to see if we can achieve the same flexibility as OMPL, but with fewer footguns and with more provable correctness.
In addition, I want to make all the abstractions in this library zero-cost: it should be as performant as possible.

For now, it is highly non-working.
I really only play with this on weekends, so don't expect much progress on it.
